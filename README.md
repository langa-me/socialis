# Socialis

⚠️ Socialis has been open sourced on the 18 of December 2022 as part of the [Langa 😛](https://langa.me) project to help communities customize their own conversational assistant. **The documentation is still work in progress.** ⚠️

Socialis is a no cold start back-end to animate communities using [Langa 😛](https://langa.me) eco-system.

Socialis currently only works in pair with Internet memory augmented Transformers chat bot such as [Seeker](https://parl.ai/projects/seeker/) or [BlenderBot2/3](https://geo-not-available.blenderbot.ai/) deployed in the same Kubernetes cluster with [Langa 😛's Helm charts](https://github.com/langa-me/helm-charts).
